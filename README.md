# DNRR
Julia implementation of the Dynamic Noise Reduction Replicator (DNRR) model [*].

Folder "Polynomial" contains software used for the simulations of polynomial (cubic) maps.
Folder "Henon" contains software used for the the simulations of complete quadratic (Henon) maps.

The algorithm works with Julia 0.6.4.
